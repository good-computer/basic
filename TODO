parser:
 - immediate-only/program-only keywords
 - function arg type/count checks
 
memory management:
 - check program growth against var buffer and vice-versa, OOM if would overwrite

clearer abstractions:
- skip whitespace at start/end outside of keyword parsers?
- lift linemap->opmem loops?

execute mainloop:
- don't reset external ram position during execute if we know we're in the right spot?

functions:
  INT
  RND
  INKEY$
  LEFT$
  MID$
  RIGHT$
  TAB

keywords:
  FOR/NEXT
  LIST
  DIM
  READ/DATA
